        <h2>I just want to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me, not just because it's a special day, but because you are special to me every single day. Since the moment you came into my life, things just started to feel different, better, lighter, happier. You brought a kind of peace and joy that I never knew I needed. And the more I get to know you, the more I fall in love with your heart, your smile, your voice, your soul. Everything about you feels like home. You make me want to be the best version of myself. Not because you ask me to, but because you believe in me, and that belief gives me strength. You support me in ways you probably don't even realize, and you love me in a way that makes me feel safe and valued. W've shared laughs, deep talks, small moments, and big emotions, and I wouldn't trade a single second of it. And as we keep moving forward, I want you to know this: I'm all in. For the good days, the hard days, and everything in between. I'll always be here, loving you, growing with you, and choosing you repeatedly. Thank you for being in my life. Thank you for being you. I love you more than words can ever fully express.</h2>
